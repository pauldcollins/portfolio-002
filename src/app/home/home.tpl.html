				<p>Here I was the lead Front End Developer for the first section released on Medibank's new <strong>Java/Adobe CQ5 Platform</strong>.</p>
				<p>The responsive front end was built using a mixture of existing components as well as new ones I'd created for the Medibank Style Guide. I was also required to make sure it achieved a <strong>AA rating for WCAG 2.0</strong>. We collaborated in an Agile team using JIRA &amp; Stash.</p>

				<p>Here I was also the lead Front End Developer for the newly floated Medibank investor centre site, built on a <strong>Java/Adobe CQ5 Platform</strong>.</p>
				<p>The responsive front end was also built using components I created for the style guide, which we again integrated into CQ5 templates.</p>
				<p>The site used <strong>Iguana</strong> to bring in all the ASX share information and I worked with their team to customise how the data was presented.</p>

				<p>This was a single page app I built for potential customers to weigh up their current health plans against a Medibank one.</p>
				<p>I built the app using a combination of <strong>JQuery, CSS and HTML5</strong>. The backend was a <strong>.NET</strong> environment and I worked with the developers to integrate the page.</p>

				<p>Stop Phubbing was a fun project I took over and completed as the sole Front End Dev. The idea was to bring awareness to "the act of snubbing someone in a social setting by looking at your phone instead of paying attention".</p>
				<p>I built the site animation using a combination of <strong>JQuery, CSS and HTML5</strong>.</p>
